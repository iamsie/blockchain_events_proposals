# Blockchain Events Proposals
## About
If you are going to hold or know an **ONLINE** meet-up, conference, hackathon, or another event in the **BLOCKCHAIN** industry that can be helpful to developers, then you are welcome to create a **Proposal**. 

## General rules on how to write a Proposal: 
* It should be a markdown file;
* After creating it, you need to make a git pull request to the **master** branch;
* Then, it will take time to consider the application;
* Each proposal will have a status. It was made to create a convenient way for users to get know what happens with their proposal. The status is updated by pull requests. 

### Status types:
* **Proposed:** means that the application was just submitted;
* **Reviewed:** means that the application is reviewed by the developers;
* **Accepted**: the application is submitted and will be added on the site soon;
* **Rejected:** the application was rejected by developers (the rejection reason will be defined in the commit message);
* **InfoLack:** the developers need more information;
* **InforAdded:** the requested information is added by the proposer;
* **Published:** the event was added on the site. You can view it on http://88.218.28.126:4001/.

## Step-by-step example:
1. You create a git pull request and add the status **Proposed**;
1. Once the developers take it into consideration, they change the status from **Proposed** to **Reviewed**;
1. It may happen that some information is missed and the reason is not specified. In such cases, the developers change the status from **Reviewed** to **InfoLack**;
1. The person who created a proposal need to specify these points and change the status from **InfoLack** to **InfoAdded**;
1. The developers take it into consideration and change the status from **InfoAdded** to **Reviewed**;
1. If all is ok, the status will be changed to **Accepted**, and then to **Published**. The **Rejected** status canâ€™t be changed again.
